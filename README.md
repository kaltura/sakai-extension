# Kaltura Video Tool for Sakai
This tool is built on top of the Kaltura Application Framework (KAF), a feature-rich framework that allows flexible and streamlined integration of Kaltura’s video solutions and products. KAF is hosted and served directly from the Kaltura cloud servers and integrated into your Sakai environment presenting different video components and workflows to users that will enjoy new features as they are released.

This tool also exposes an enhanced LTI role-mapping capability to get better granularity than what Sakai provides by default.

*The formally supported releases appear under [releases](https://github.com/kaltura/sakai-extension/releases), It is advised to only use releases marked as "latest release". Using code from any branch (including "master") is not recommended and not officially supported.*
